Recipe Website Project
So far, I've set up a new repo, and cloned it to my local machine. I used the command line to check if the repo was connected
to github, I used the command line to navigate in and out of different directories when I made mistakes, and I'm glad that 
some of what I'm learning is sticking, and it's definitely the things that I've used again and again. I'm excited to learn more
and progress towards my goals of becoming a developer.
