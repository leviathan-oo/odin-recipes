        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a great recipe that I definitely DID NOT find in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was NOT a family favorite, and it's just a really old recipe...</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoons salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
